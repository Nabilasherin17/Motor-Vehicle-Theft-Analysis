# Motor-Vehicle-Theft-Analysis
This project is a database system designed to track and analyze stolen vehicle data. The database contains tables that store detailed information about stolen vehicles, the regions where they were stolen, and the vehicle make details. The system helps in identifying patterns in vehicle thefts, such as which types of vehicles are stolen the most, which regions experience the highest number of thefts, and when these thefts are most likely to occur.

# What I Do in This Project
In this project, we analyze stolen vehicle data stored in a relational database (stolen_vehicles_db). The database consists of three key tables:

stolen_vehicles: Stores details about stolen vehicles, including vehicle ID, type, make, model year, color, and the date and location of the theft.
locations: Contains information about the regions where the vehicles were stolen, including the region name, country, population, and population density.
make_details: Stores information about vehicle makes, including make ID, make name, and make type.
The project includes several analyses to derive insights from the data. These analyses answer the following questions:

# 1. What day of the week are vehicles most often and least often stolen?
This analysis helps us determine the days of the week when vehicle thefts occur most and least frequently. By examining this data, we can identify patterns in theft activity over the course of the week.

# 2. What types of vehicles are most often and least often stolen? Does this vary by region?
This analysis looks at the types of vehicles that are stolen most often, and whether these theft patterns differ based on geographic region. It helps us understand if certain vehicle types are more susceptible to theft in specific areas.

# 3. What is the average age of the vehicles that are stolen? Does this vary based on the vehicle type?
This analysis calculates the average age of stolen vehicles and investigates whether the age of stolen vehicles differs by vehicle type. It helps identify whether older or newer vehicles are more likely to be stolen.

# 4. Which regions have the most and least number of stolen vehicles? What are the characteristics of the regions?
This analysis identifies the regions with the highest and lowest rates of stolen vehicles. It also provides insights into the population and density characteristics of these regions, helping us understand the relationship between vehicle theft and regional factors.

# Insights and Recommendations
Based on the analyses conducted on the stolen vehicle data, we can derive several insights that can guide preventive measures and decision-making. These insights provide a deeper understanding of vehicle theft patterns, which can be useful for law enforcement, insurance companies, city planners, and other stakeholders in vehicle security.

 # 1] Day of the Week for Vehicle Thefts:
* Insight: By analyzing the days of the week when vehicle thefts occur, we may find that certain days, such as weekends or specific weekdays, experience higher theft rates. This could suggest a correlation between theft activity and certain times, possibly due to factors like reduced security, fewer law enforcement patrols, or vehicle owners' habits (e.g., leaving cars unattended for longer periods on certain days).
* Recommendation: Authorities should consider enhancing patrols or implementing additional surveillance in areas where thefts peak on specific days. Public awareness campaigns could also encourage vehicle owners to take extra precautions on high-risk days.

# 2] Vehicle Types Most Often and Least Often Stolen:
*  Insight: Certain vehicle types, such as luxury cars, SUVs, or specific makes, may be stolen more frequently than others. This could be due to factors like the desirability of parts, ease of resale, or high market demand for specific vehicles. Additionally, the region in which the vehicle is stolen may influence these theft patterns.
* Recommendation: Owners of high-risk vehicle types, such as luxury vehicles, should invest in enhanced security measures (e.g., GPS tracking, steering wheel locks). Law enforcement should focus on areas with high rates of theft for specific vehicle types to deter thieves and implement more targeted security efforts.

# 3] Average Age of Stolen Vehicles:
* Insight: Analyzing the average age of stolen vehicles can provide insights into which vehicles are most at risk. Older vehicles may be stolen more often due to less advanced security features, while newer vehicles may be targeted for their technology or parts.
* Recommendation: Vehicle owners should consider upgrading their security systems, especially for older models. Additionally, promoting the installation of advanced anti-theft technologies (e.g., alarms, immobilizers) could significantly reduce theft risks for vehicles, regardless of their age.

# 4] Regions with High and Low Theft Rates:
* Insight: By identifying regions with the highest and lowest vehicle theft rates, authorities can better allocate resources and prioritize areas with the most significant need for anti-theft initiatives. Factors like population density and urbanization may correlate with higher theft rates, as crowded areas with higher foot traffic may present more opportunities for theft.
* Recommendation: Local governments and law enforcement agencies should focus on high-theft regions, increasing surveillance, conducting community outreach, and encouraging citizens to be vigilant. Urban areas with higher population density may benefit from better infrastructure, such as more public cameras or neighborhood watch programs. In less densely populated areas, efforts could focus on increasing awareness and offering incentives for residents to adopt better security practices.
